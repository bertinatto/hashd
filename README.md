# hashd - a simple in-memory cache

hashd is a modest in-memory cache developed in C. A toy project. 

## FAQ

### Why a in-memory hash table?

It seemed like a perfect opportunity to implement several concepts that I had little or none experience with. Among them:

* Free lists
* Memory fragmentation
* OpenBSD coding practices
* Benchmark and optimization of several data structures in C
* Protocol design and implementation
* Socket programming

### Is it ready?

Not at all! Given that it's a toy project, I might not ever finish it. Simple *sets* and *gets* are working, thought.
